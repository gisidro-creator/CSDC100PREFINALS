          <h1>Frequently Asked Questions About GenAI</h1>
          <p>Gen AI may look scary and difficult to use at first, especially with all the talk about risks, misinformation, and rapid changes in technology. But like any new tool, it becomes far easier once you understand its basics and learn how to use it responsibly. With the right guidance and a clear awareness of both its strengths and limitations, Gen AI can become a helpful partner in learning, creativity, and productivity—rather.</p>

            <summary>What is Gen AI?</summary>
            <p>Generative AI, sometimes called Gen AI, is artificial intelligence (AI) that can create original content such as text, images, video, audio, or software code in response to a user’s prompt or request.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Examples of Gen AI tools</summary>
            <p>Examples of GenAI tools include text generators like ChatGPT and Claude, image generators like Midjourney and DALL-E 3, video generators like Synthesia, and code assistants like GitHub Copilot</p>

            <summary>What can GenAI do (strengths)?</summary>
             <p>GenAI can create original and varied content by recognizing patterns in the data it was trained on, providing new perspectives and ideas.</p>
            <p>It can understand and generate human-like text, summarize or simplify complex ideas, and work in multiple languages, helping those who are not native English speakers or have different literacy levels.</p>
            <p>GenAI can be adapted for various tasks like chatbots, content creation, translations, or summarizing information, reducing repetitive work and boosting productivity.</p>
            <p>Some models can remember past interactions, giving more relevant responses, adapting to your style, helping you learn, or providing real-time answers.</p>
            <p>GenAI is becoming common in workplaces and learning tools, like Microsoft Copilot or Grammarly’s AI features.</p>

            <summary>What are its limitations or risks?</summary>
                <p>GenAI can produce convincing but incorrect information, known as hallucinations. These models do not truly understand content, and the data they learn from can be inaccurate or biased.</p>
                <p>AI can also generate fake news, misinformation, and deepfakes. Because outputs are based on patterns—not facts—everything produced must be independently verified.</p>
                <p>Copyright is another issue. GenAI often imitates existing content without permission. This raises questions about ownership, intellectual property, and legal responsibility.</p>
                <p>Training AI models consumes massive amounts of electricity, resulting in a large carbon footprint and environmental impact.</p>
