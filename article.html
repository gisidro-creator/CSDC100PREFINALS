          <h1> Analogy on the use of AI in Dev Work</h1>
          <p>You are organizing your wedding, the documentation team is asking 40k for the wedding package. They will use an Iphone 16 pro max to cover the event and CapCut for the same day edit video. The documentation team has 2 years of experience and has an above average portfolio. Would you agree to that deal? Explain your answer and justify the integrity of their work. Reflect on the integrity, creativity, skill level of the “vibe” coders</p>

        <H1>Answer to the Analogy</H1>
        <p>If I was in that given scenario I would respectfully reject the proposal of the documentation team. The use of readily available and easy to access tools is not  a reflection of high-level skill or creativity. While these tools can create decent results, relying primarily on these can result in the limitation of uniqueness,originality and creativity. Just like how “Vibe Coders” rely on AI generated codes rather than coding it manually. This convenient approach in creating products
        Can compromise the authenticity and depth of the final output. It may lead to a product that is considered generic and lacks personality, much as how the output of vibe coders may function correctly but misses the creative problem solving done by a human coder. That is why, while convenience  is gained, the  originality  and high skill level of the work are nowhere to be seen. Therefore making it hard to justify their high cost of service.
