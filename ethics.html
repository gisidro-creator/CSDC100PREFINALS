          <h1>Ethical Use of GenAI</h1>
          <p>Ethical use of Generative AI means using AI tools responsibly, fairly, and transparently.
             It involves understanding their limitations, avoiding misuse, protecting privacy, and ensuring that the technology supports learning and creativity without causing harm.</p>

            <h1>GenAi in Academia</h1>
            <p>
            Generative AI can be a powerful tool in learning, but it must be used responsibly. 
            Ethical use means understanding both its benefits and its risks. Students and educators 
            should use AI to support learning—not replace original thinking—while ensuring accuracy, 
            fairness, and respect for academic integrity. Responsible use also includes checking 
            AI-generated information, avoiding plagiarism, being aware of potential bias, and using these 
            tools in a way that supports honest and meaningful learning.
            </p>
            <h1>Avoiding plagiarism and misuse</h1>
            <p>Cite Your Sources When Using AI Verifying sources ensures that the information being used is accurate and reliable. Researchers should give credit to the original authors and acknowledge their contributions to the field. This not only upholds academic integrity but also allows readers to trace the origins of ideas.</p>
            <h1>Accuracy and verification of AI outputs</h1>
            <p>To ensure AI output accuracy, users must verify all facts, statistics, and claims against multiple reputable sources and be wary of potential errors like "hallucinated" citations</p>
            <h1>Bias and fairness</h1>
            <p>Bias in AI refers to systematic errors in data or algorithms that can lead to unfair outcomes, while fairness is the ethical goal of ensuring AI systems treat individuals and groups equitably.</p>
            <h1>Recommendation in using GenAI Ethically</h1>
            <p>When using GenAI tools, it is important to remember that all content generated by AI is based on existing ideas, literature, art, and other forms of content. You should not claim AI-generated content as your own original work. Always ensure proper credits where needed and use AI outputs responsibly to support learning and creativity.</p>
